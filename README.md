# Car insurance claim
In this project we classified the customers of the car insurance company based on many features (variables) to build a model and thus predict whether the customer claimed for the car insurance or not. In this regard we gather the data from here and used four machine learning models namely logistic regression, KNN, SVM and XGBoost to come up with the best results based on different metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AIC, etc. The variables in the dataset are as follow:
